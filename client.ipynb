        "Chunking plays an important role in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in order to index the textual data in an appropriate format for retrieval. The size of chunks are usually predetermined, i.e. set or limited by a fixed size during the data ingestion phase. Seqtra combines chunking and retrieving in one stage, i.e. chunking only with respect to the query during retrieval rather than defining chunk boundary during the ingestion phase, making the chunk sizes dynamic and adapted to the query. This strategy is known as late chunking in literature. Seqtra constructs and utilizes graph-based relationships in order to chunk the documents.\n",

This graph represents relationship among chunks in \"chunks\" key. if, for example, num_seed_node is set to 1, and you have used one of graph strategies, one of the chunks is the seed node, and additional nodes are retrieved due to their links to the seed node as extracted during the ingestion stage. \"nodes\" data also contains pdf name, page number and bounding box information to locate the exact section of the chunk in the pdf. Bounding box is in the format of (left, top, width, height).\n",
